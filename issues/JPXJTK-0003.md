## Description

`git pad remote` like `git branch`
shows remote information.

Since there is no concept of branches in issues ref,
there is no tracking remote, just remote = tracking remote!
! But there could be multiple remotes like `origin`, `origin2`, `local`, or mirror remote, etc.
`git pad track $REMOTE` or `git pad remote $REMOTE`

so basically `git pad remote` shows `git pad track`?
