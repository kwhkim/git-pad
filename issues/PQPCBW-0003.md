title: git-issue invariance check
type: enhancement
priority: P3
status: open
---

## Description

Using git commands like git reset, git push --force, etc in git-issue worktree
might restort git-issue's invariance and make git-issue to malfunction.

So it would be nice to have a function to check and restore the invariance.

## Steps to Reproduce

## Expected Behavior

git issue check(?)
git issue check-invariace(?)
git issue fsck(?)

## Notes
