## Description

When creating a new issue file,
an editor is launched and pre-populated from the template file,

a user might want to record the current branches, or relevant information about the working in progress.

## Steps to Reproduce

## Expected Behavior

1. When starting `git pad new`, you might select which information to record(like current HEAD's hash, etc.)
2. Or, by default, the editor could be pre-populated with relevant information, in addition to the contents of the template file,
   so that user might choose to keep it or remove it.
3.
